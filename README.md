0-SECURITIES
Problem Definition
We want to create a class that can be used to represent a security. Securities have names which are unique identifiers of what they represent. Additionally securities have a monetary value associated with them but for now we'll ignore any valuations. The class we create should satisfy the following.

Allow for the name of a security to be stored on object construction & via a setter function
Allow for the name of the security to be retrieved via a getter
